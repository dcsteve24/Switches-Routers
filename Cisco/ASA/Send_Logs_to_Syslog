**	SEVERITY IN EVENT	Default SMS setting for Syslog Security option. This setting will send all events to remote Syslog system
0	EMERGENCY	A "panic" condition - notify all tech staff on call? (Earthquake? Tornado?) - affects multiple apps/servers/sites.
1	ALERT	Should be corrected immediately - notify staff who can fix the problem - example is loss of backup ISP connection.
2	CRITICAL	Should be corrected immediately, but indicates failure in a primary system - fix CRITICAL problems before ALERT - example is loss of primary ISP connection.
3	ERROR	Non-urgent failures - these should be relayed to developers or admins; each item must be resolved within a given time.
4	WARNING	Warning messages - not an error, but indication that an error will occur if action is not taken, e.g. file system 85% full - each item must be resolved within a given time.
5	NOTICE	Events that are unusual but not error conditions - might be summarized in an email to developers or admins to spot potential problems - no immediate action required.
6	INFORMATIONAL	Normal operational messages - may be harvested for reporting, measuring throughput, etc. - no action required.
7	DEBUG	Info useful to developers for debugging the app, not useful during operations.
