#CatalystIOS

When a switch boots to rommon it didnt pick up a bootable device. This is common after a factory reset.

Do the following to see if it can see a bootflash:
1. dir bootflash:
  You will see a file name (hopefully). If not you need to install a new boot flash or hardware is corrupt.
2. If you say the file, type: boot bootflash:<filename>
3. It should start registering the IOS and eventually come back as expected.
