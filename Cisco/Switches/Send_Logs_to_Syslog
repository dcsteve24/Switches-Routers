1. Login
2. Type "conf t" to enter the configuration terminal
3. Type "service timestamps debug datetime msec" to enable detailed logging with timestamps
4. Type "logging host <ip address>" to send logs to the ip address.
    Note logs go over port UDP/514 and there is no way to change this from the switch side. I do have workarounds if the syslog is a RedhAt OS through firewalld port forwarding.
5. Ensure you can ping the address so you know communications will reach: "ping <ip address>".
6. Logs should start reaching after a brief period. Ensure you save your configurations with "copy run start"
